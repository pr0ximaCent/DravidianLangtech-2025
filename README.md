## Shared Task on Detecting AI-Generated Product Reviews in Dravidian Languages: DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025

The **Shared Task on Detecting AI-Generated Product Reviews in Dravidian Languages** addresses the growing concern of AI-generated content in online reviews, specifically focusing on Dravidian languages such as **Malayalam** and **Tamil**. As AI tools become increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated content has become crucial, particularly in the domain of online product reviews where authenticity plays a vital role in consumer decision-making.

This shared task aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate models that can accurately identify AI-generated reviews in these languages. Participants will work with datasets containing both human-written and AI-generated reviews, tackling the unique challenges posed by Dravidian languages.Paper has been accepted.

### Task Details

- **Languages**: Malayalam and Tamil
- **Datasets**: Participants will receive training and test datasets in both languages.
- **Evaluation Metric**: Models will be evaluated based on their **F1 score**, a standard metric in NLP used for assessing classification performance.
- **Participation**: Open to participants worldwide.

### How to Participate

1. Access the datasets and additional details via the **CodaLab** platform.
2. Navigate to the "Participate" tab to download the data and register for the task.

This shared task is an exciting opportunity for the global research community to contribute to advancing natural language processing capabilities in underrepresented languages. Join us in tackling this critical challenge at **DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025**.
